## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to use flex as well as how desktop-first development kind of suck even though I like to do it that way. It sucks as in when I come to mobile I generally become lazy so if I get mobile first out of the way the intresting stuff could keep my interest level up.

### Continued development

I have started understanding how cards are made generally but from my next challenge i would love to explore advanced css like trying out scss or sass so that my speed of solving this challenge increase.
